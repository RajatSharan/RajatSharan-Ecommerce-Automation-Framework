**Playwright Automation with JavaScript (POM Approach)**
This repository contains a robust test automation framework built using Playwright and JavaScript, leveraging the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for scalability and maintainability.

**Project Overview**
The purpose of this project is to:

**Automate end-to-end testing of web applications.**
Ensure maintainable and reusable test scripts using the POM design pattern.
Enable seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.
**Key Features**
Playwright Framework:

Supports cross-browser testing on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
Provides built-in test runner for efficient test execution.
Page Object Model (POM):

Modular design for test scripts, enhancing maintainability.
Separation of test logic from UI interactions.
Test Reporting and Debugging:

Integrated with Playwright’s reporting tools for detailed test reports.
Screenshot and video recording on test failures for debugging.
Continuous Integration:

Configured for GitHub Actions/CircleCI to run tests on every commit.
